build-configmap.py
==================
Generate the `additionalObjects` block for authentik `values.yaml` from the
sanitized blueprint files in this directory.

Authentik's Helm chart mounts blueprints from a ConfigMap via
`blueprints.configMaps`. Because the authentik ArgoCD Application is a Helm
chart source (not a directory source), the blueprint ConfigMap must be
rendered through the chart's `additionalObjects` field in `values.yaml`.

This script reads every `*.sanitized.yaml` file in this directory and prints
the `additionalObjects` YAML block. Paste the output into
`apps/dmz/authentik/values.yaml` under the `additionalObjects:` key.

Usage:
    python3 build-configmap.py

Prerequisites:
    1. Export each object from the Authentik UI (the `{ }` icon).
    2. Run `python3 sanitize-blueprints.py <exported>.yaml` to produce
       `<exported>.yaml.sanitized.yaml`.
    3. Run this script and paste the output into values.yaml.
    4. Populate the Kubernetes Secret `authentik-blueprint-env` with the
       env vars the sanitizer reported (AUTHENTIK_BP_*).
